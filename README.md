# PROTRAIT dashboard

This repository is a collection of all the visualisations created for PROTRAIT data stored in GraphDB.

Two parts to the visualisation - 
1. SPARQL query to obtain information from [GraphDB](https://graphdb.ontotext.com/)
2. Javascript for creating the charts/visuals. It's based on [PLOTLY](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js) library.

The dashboards are contained within [REDASH](https://github.com/getredash/redash) with SPARQL endpoint.
